This optical illusion can be interpreted in two ways: it can be seen as a vase (the central shape) or as two human faces in profile (the shapes on either side). \n\nFor psychology students, this illustration exemplifies how perception can be influenced by context and awareness. It highlights the concept of figure-ground perception, which refers to the visual distinction between an object (figure) and its background (ground). The dual interpretations also demonstrate cognitive flexibility, as individuals may switch between perspectives based on their focus. This phenomenon is often studied in cognitive and perceptual psychology to understand how humans process visual information."

This tests verbal response and automatic reading.\n\n2. **Part 2 (Card C)**: Participants name the color of colored rectangles. This task evaluates attention and color recognition independent of word meaning.\n\n3. **Part 3 (Card B)**: Participants name the color of the ink used for words that represent different colors (e.g., the word \"BLUE\" in red ink). This setup highlights cognitive conflict, as it requires overriding the automatic response of reading the word itself.\n\nThe overall purpose is to assess how word meaning interferes with color identification, illustrating the complexities of cognitive processing and the effects of automaticity."
